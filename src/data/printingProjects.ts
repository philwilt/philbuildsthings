    title: 'Articulated Glow Dinosaurs',
    description:
      'Multi-color, glow-in-the-dark articulated dinosaurs made as birthday gifts for two brothers and their dino-loving cousins — toys designed to be just as display-worthy as they are fun to play with. Printed fully assembled on a Bambu Lab multi-material system using PLA, silk, and glow filaments, each dinosaur moves straight off the build plate and glows at night. The project became an exploration in multi-material workflows and small-batch production, turning a one-off gift into a repeatable maker process.',

    title: 'Year of the Horse',
    description:
      'Created for 2026 — a Fire Horse year — this glow-in-the-dark Bambu print reflects the Horse’s symbolism of momentum, independence, and forward drive. The luminous material brings the form to life after dark, turning it into a small personal totem for motion and becoming. A reminder to keep building, keep moving, and follow what’s next with energy and intent.',

    title: 'Spiral Orb Pendant Light',
    description:
      'This spiral orb pendant light explores translucency and organic geometry through a 3D-printed green PETG shade that diffuses light into soft gradients and layered shadows. A rear bayonet opening and integrated printed pendant and socket mount create a clean, fully assembled hanging fixture built entirely from printed components. Part of an ongoing 3D-printed lighting series, the piece blends material, form, and illumination into a sculptural object that feels alive with light.',
