## Short About
Phil Builds Things LLC is a hands-on workshop for building, experimenting, and learning in public.

From software and AI to fabrication, tools, and physical objects, this is a place for curious projects,
thoughtful engineering, and making ideas real, one build at a time.

Fueled by curiosity, coffee, and a love of figuring things out.

## Long About
Phil Builds Things LLC is a studio and workshop focused on building things that didn't exist yesterday.

The work spans software, AI systems, digital tools, fabrication, and physical objects with an emphasis
on learning in public, thoughtful problem-solving, and practical creativity.

Some projects are experiments. Some turn into products. Some exist just to answer a question.

Everything here is powered by curiosity, coffee, and the belief that making things is one of the best
ways to understand the world.
